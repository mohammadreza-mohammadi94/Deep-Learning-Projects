## Projects Overview

This repository includes the following deep learning projects:

1. **Image Classification**
   - A project that classifies images into different categories using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
   
2. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and language modeling using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers.

3. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
   - Projects focusing on generating new data samples, such as images, that resemble the training data.

4. **Object Detection**
   - Implementations of object detection models to identify and localize objects within images.

5. **Time Series Forecasting**
   - Forecasting future data points in a time series using LSTM networks and other deep learning models.
