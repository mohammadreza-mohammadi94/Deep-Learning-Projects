# EuroSAT Satellite Image Classification with CNN

This project provides an end-to-end workflow for classifying EuroSAT satellite images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow.

---

## üõ∞ Dataset

- **EuroSAT:** 27,000 labeled images covering 10 land-use classes.
- Images are 64x64 RGB.
- Classes include: AnnualCrop, Forest, HerbaceousVegetation, Highway, Industrial, Pasture, PermanentCrop, Residential, River, SeaLake.

Dataset can be downloaded [here](http://madm.dfki.de/files/sentinel/EuroSAT.zip).

## üõ† Features

- TensorFlow data pipeline for efficient loading and preprocessing.
- Data augmentation to reduce overfitting.
- CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
- Softmax output for multi-class classification.
- Training visualization with learning curves (accuracy & loss).
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report.

## üìä Usage

1. Download and extract the EuroSAT dataset.
2. Rename the extracted folder to `EuroSAT` and place it in the working directory.
3. Adjust parameters (image size, batch size, epochs) if needed.
4. Run the script:

```bash
python euro_sat_cnn.py
````
