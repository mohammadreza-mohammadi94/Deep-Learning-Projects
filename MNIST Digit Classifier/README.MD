# MNIST Digit Classifier

This repository contains a deep learning project focused on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project aims to explore and implement various CNN architectures to improve classification performance.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: The MNIST dataset will be downloaded and preprocessed.
- **Models**: Implementations of different CNN architectures.
- **Training**: Code to train the models on the MNIST dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Functions to evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/Deep-Learning-Projects.git
   cd Deep-Learning-Projects/MNIST Digit Classifier
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required libraries installed.

## Future Work

This repository will be continuously updated with implementations of other CNN architectures to compare their performance on the MNIST dataset.
