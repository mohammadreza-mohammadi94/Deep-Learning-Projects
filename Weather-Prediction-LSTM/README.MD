# 🌦️ Weather Prediction using LSTM  

This project demonstrates how to predict weather patterns using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks. The model is trained on historical weather data to forecast future weather conditions effectively.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- Data preprocessing and normalization  
- LSTM model for time-series forecasting  
- Visualization of predictions vs actual weather data  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow/Keras  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## 🎯 Objective  
The goal is to showcase the application of LSTM networks in time-series forecasting for weather prediction.  

## 📊 Results  
The model predicts weather trends based on historical data, highlighting the power of LSTMs in sequence modeling.
