# 🥁 Rhythm Detection from MIDI Files

This project uses an LSTM-based RNN to learn and predict rhythmic patterns from MIDI files.

---

## 📌 Features

* Downloads and processes MIDI files
* Extracts rhythm sequences
* Trains an LSTM model to predict the next beat
* Saves the trained model for reuse

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python, TensorFlow
* music21, mido, NumPy, scikit-learn

---

## 📁 Output

* Trained model: `rhythm_detection_model.h5`
* Logs: `log.log`

---

## 📬 Usage

Run the notebook to:

* Download MIDI dataset
* Train the model
* Predict and save rhythm patterns
