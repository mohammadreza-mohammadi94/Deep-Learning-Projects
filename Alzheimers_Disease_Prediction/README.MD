# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project predicts Alzheimer's disease using patient information, not MRI images. The dataset includes clinical and demographic data of individuals with and without Alzheimer's disease.

## Project Overview

The goal is to predict whether a person has Alzheimer's based on features like age, gender, and medical history. The project implements and compares several machine learning and deep learning models.

## Models Used

- **XGBoost Classifier**
- **RandomForest Classifier**
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

## Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing:** Scaled numerical features, and encoded categorical variables.
- **Model Comparison:** Trained and evaluated multiple models, including XGBoost, RandomForest, and an ANN built using Keras.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and compare models.

## Dataset

The dataset includes clinical and demographic information, with labels indicating Alzheimer's diagnosis.
